# Bender

Bender is a lightweight web service intended, primarily, to act as a "Hello World" example for various web API frameworks. Of course, it is also a source of randomly selected Futurama quotes, which never gets old!

## Example

The quickest place to start is by clicking [this ðŸ”´ button](https://bender.sierrasoftworks.com/api/v1/quote), but if you'd prefer something you can toss into your filthy terminal history, then please, be my guest...

```bash
Î» curl -H 'Accept: text/plain' https://bender.sierrasoftworks.com/api/v1/quote
What's wrong? Did you swallow another cell phone? â€“ Leela
```

## Self-Hosting

If you just can't help but flit away your pocket money on pushing pointless bits around the internet, you can run your own Bender instance by following [our instructions](hosting/getting-started.md) \(or just doing your own thing\).
